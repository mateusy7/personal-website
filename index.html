        <h2>Welcome. This website is a portfolio of my work.</h2>
        <p>Go to the <a href="math.html">Mathematics</a> section to explore my working in
             Algebra, Calculus, Probability & Statistics, and Linear Algebra.</p>
        <p>My explanation and working of MIT's 18.100A Real Analysis course can be found on
            my YouTube channel here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@matiuschong/videos">Real Analysis</a>.
            I had to take a break on the 16th January to focus on my semester 1 exams. I will resume after
            my last paper on the 4th Febryary.</p>
        <p>My dissertation in my final year is titled
             <a href="docs/Research Paper First Semester.pdf" target="_blank">"Optimization-based control in Portfolio Optimization"</a>.
            I have completed the first half of it in my first semester which reviews traditional Modern Portfolio Theory
            from mathematical first principles. Control techniques will be implemented in my second semester of university.</p>
        <p>This is my Kumon <a href="docs/Kumon Certificate.pdf">Certificate</a> showing that I was 3 years ahead of my peers achieving the Level I in
            Kumon mathematics covering algebra right up to inequalities, quadratic equations and systems of 
            equations at age 10 in Primary 4.</p>
